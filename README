High Performance Serialization

JID can deserialize/update/reserialize a map of 10,000 entries in 4 milliseconds,
running on an i5 at 2.53 GHz, where serialization/reserialization timings are
independent of the size and complexity of the table entries.

Fast serialization/deserialization is critical for databases. The key is to
deserialize only what you need and to keep the serialized data for items that have
not been changed for reserialization after an update.

The JID project includes a number of actors which support different types of
persistent data. These actors can in turn be subclassed to add application logic.
Incremental serialization/deserialization is used to achieve high-performance.

JID Container actors:
 - ListJid,
 - MapJid,
 - TupleJid and
 - ActorJid,
where ListJid and MapJid are homogeneous collections and TupleJid is hetrogenous.
(ActorJid can hold any type of Actor which subclasses Jid.)

JID scalar actors:
 - BooleanJid,
 - IntegerJid,
 - LongJid,
 - FloatJid,
 - DoubleJid and
 - StringJid.

(Only IntegerJid, LongJid and StringJid can be used as keys in a MapJid.)
