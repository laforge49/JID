High Performance Serialization

Fast deserialization/reserialization is critical for databases. The key is to
deserialize only what you need and to keep the serialized data for items that have
not been changed for reserialization after an update.

Application are built by subclassing existing JID actors and then composing more
complex structures from them. The JID project includes a number of actors which
support different types of persistent data.

JID can deserialize/update/reserialize a map of 10,000 entries in .9 milliseconds,
where deserialization/reserialization timings are largely independent of the size
and complexity of the table entries. That's 90 nanoseconds per table entry, where
the entries are actor key / actor value pairs.

Test Environment

i7-3770 @ 3.40 GHz
ASUS P8Z77-M Motherboard
16 GB Corsair DDR3 1600 MHz RAM
Vertex 3 SATA III SSD

JID Container actors:
 - ListJid,
 - MapJid,
 - TupleJid and
 - ActorJid,
where ListJid and MapJid are homogeneous collections and TupleJid is heterogenous,
where the actor types of the contents are fixed when defining the actor type of the
collection.

ActorJid, in contrast, can hold any type of Actor which subclasses Jid. This is
made possible by including the actor type of the contents when an ActorJid is
serialized.

JID scalar actors:
 - BooleanJid,
 - IntegerJid,
 - LongJid,
 - FloatJid,
 - DoubleJid and
 - StringJid.

(Only IntegerJid, LongJid and StringJid can be used as keys in a MapJid.)
